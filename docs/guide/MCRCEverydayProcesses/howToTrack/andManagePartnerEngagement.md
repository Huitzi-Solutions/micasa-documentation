## ... and manage Partner Engagement

**Doc version:** 2021

### **Objective:**  
In this section you will find how to track and Manage Partner Engagement

### **Where is it located within the Salesforce Org?** 
| Navigation inside the Org. E.G [Mi Casa App | Contacts | Related | Forms](https://micasa.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Contact/0032M00003AyyzYQAR/view)

**Difficulty:** Advanced.

<u>**Adding Partner Organizations/Companies**</u>

1.In the Global Search Bar, type the name of the organization or company and hit enter to view all search results.

2.If the company or organization is not in Salesforce, you can **add a new Partner Account**

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/andManagePartnerEngament/2.png')" alt="foo">

  a. Click on the arrow next to the Accounts tab (shaped like a v) 

  b. Select + New Account 

  c. Select Partner Directory as the record type and click Next

  d. Enter the organization or company name in the Account Name, as it appears on the company website. Do not use acronyms or a portion of the name, unless adding to the end of the full name – for example, “Community College or Aurora (CCA)”. Using acronyms or nicknames creates confusion in the system and we run the risk of having more than one account for the same company. Examples:

      i. “Partner Colorado Credit Union” rather than “Partner”

      ii. “Denver Public Schools” rather than “DPS”
  
  e. Under Status choose “Current Partner”

  f. For Type of Organization, select the most accurate option.

  g. If the organization or company is an employer partner, check the Employer Partner box

  h. Add as much contact information for the organization as possible.

  i. Skip the ProBoPat Hours section.

  j. Click Save


### **Adding Partner Contacts**
1. Individuals who work at partner organizations have Partner Contact records in Salesforce. To search for an individual, first go to the Partner Account for their organization. Open the Related tab and then click View All in the Contacts tile. This will show you all Partner Contacts connected to that Account.
You can also search the individual's name in the Global Search Bar – they may already exist in Salesforce, connected to a previous employer.

2. If you search and the individual is not listed, go to the organization’s Account. 

  a. Select “New” in the Contacts section

  b. Select Partner as the record type and click Next 

  c. Fill in as much information as you can – Name, Title, Email, and Phone are particularly important to capture

  d. Under Partner Type select the Mi Casa program/department this individual partners with

  e. Under Partner Status, select the individual’s current status as an MCRC partner

  f. Check the Employer Partner box if this individual is an employer partner

  g. Choose the applicable Type of Practitioner if this individual is a patent practitioner

  h. Skip the ProBoPat Hours and ProBoPat Volunteer Information sections

  i. Click Save

Emails to/from Partner Contacts should be logged to Salesforce directly from Outlook. You can also send emails from their Partner Contact in Salesforce – this has the added advantage of seeing if/when the recipient has opened the email. Logging emails/calls with Partner Contacts helps us streamline communication with partners and collaborate better across Mi Casa.

### **Adding/Tracking Partner Engagements**

Just like work with our participants, it should be our practice to **document all partner engagement!** This gives us a clear picture of the ways that we are engaging with our partners and they are engaging with us! Please note there are multiple ways to enter partner engagements, but the steps below should be the standard method.

  1. Search for and open the Partner Account for the organization or company. (If not found, see above steps to create Partner Account for the organization)

  2. Click on the Related tab to open the lists of connected records

  3. Scroll down to the Partner Engagements tile and select New.

  4. Select Partner Engagement as the record type and click Next.

  5. Ensure that the correct Account is auto-filled in the Partner Organization – this should be the Partner Account you opened in step 1.

  6. Add “Partner Engagement” to the Partnership Name box. (Note: Salesforce will auto-update the Partnership Name once you hit Save)

  7. Search for the name of the individual from the organization or company that engaged or interacted with Mi Casa in the Partner Contact box.

    a. See step 14 below if more than one individual

  8. In general, the Participant can be left blank. If the partner interacted with an individual participant (ex. offered employment to a participant or joined a consulting appointment), search for that participant’s name in the Participant field.

  9. Enter the Date of Interaction

  10. If the partner interacted with a training cohort or specific class (ex. as a guest speaker), search the Course/Class box for the specific course or class record.

  11. Select the appropriate Type of Engagement. Most common types of engagement:
    a. Guest Speaker: use for a partner who shares in training/workshop

    b. Interview Day: use for interview day or interview week for FST

    c. Networking Event: use for Career Exploration Panel

    d. Informational Meeting: use for first time meeting or meetings about the partnership

    e. Attended Graduation: use for a partner who speaks at or attends graduation

    f. Offered employment to Mi Casa graduate: use if we know an employer partner offered employment to a participant and the participant elected not to take the job. (Note: Hired Mi Casa graduate engagements do not need to be entered manually, as they are auto-created upon entering initial Career Retentions).

12. Enter any applicable notes in the Partner Engagement Notes box. This could include the guest speaker topic.

13. Click Save 

14. Enter a new Partner Engagement for each person who engages- for example, if two people present as guest speakers, enter two different engagements 
  a. In this case of mock interviews or tours, leave the Partner Contact field blank and explain the reason in the Partner Engagement Notes.
