# **Structure of this Section**

In this section we will describe the characteristics that every active process builder has in Mi Casaâ€™s Salesforce org. We describe each process making reference to the structure of a process builder, which is described in the section called Anatomy of a Process. Below we will describe an outline of the sections.

### **Name of the process - Status (Active or Inactive)**

- **Overview** - Gives a brief description of the process.
- **Object** - Describes which object is used in the process
- **Runs when** - Describes when the process is executed
- **Fields updated by the process** - Lists all the records that are modified when and/or after the process is executed
- **Criteria of the process** - All the conditions that need to be met in order for the process to run. More details can be found here: [ Anatomy of a Process Builder](./introToProcessBuilders.md)
- **Immediate actions** - All the actions that will take place immediately when the process runs. More details can be found here: [ Anatomy of a Process Builder](./introToProcessBuilders.md)
- **Scheduled actions (optional)** - All the actions that will take place at a point in the future after the process runs. More details can be found here: [ Anatomy of a Process Builder](./introToProcessBuilders.md).
