**Doc version:** 2020

**Objective:** In this section you will find how to create a Business Counseling Survey

**Where is it located within the Salesforce Org?** | [Mi Casa App | Form | Contacts](https://micasa.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Form__c/a0t4100000DcQqnAAF/view)

**Difficulty:** Advanced.

**Steps:**

1. As soon as you’ve entered the Business Consulting appointment (or the initial 641 form), send the participant a Business Counseling Survey.

2. If adding a follow-up appointment, click on the participant’s name at the top of the Form to return to their Contact record. If adding a new case appointment, you should already be on the participant’s Contact record.

3. On the right side of the Contact record, find the Activity box. Just below the words Activity and Chatter, click on the Email tab.

4. Use the bottom highlighted in the picture above to open the template menu and select “Insert a Template.

_Note: You will likely see a warning about overwriting your current email – this is fine, because “current email” is just your email signature, and the template includes your email signature. Click Insert._

5. This will open the list of available templates to use. Select the Counseling Survey template of the appropriate language for your participant.

6. Once the template is inserted in your email box, click Send. Salesforce will auto-fill the participant’s first name, as well as your email signature.
