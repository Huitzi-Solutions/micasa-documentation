The relationship between a dashboard component and report is 1:1; for each dashboard component, there is a single underlying report. However, you can use the same report in multiple dashboard components on a single dashboard (e.g., use the same report in both a bar chart and pie chart). Multiple dashboard components can be shown together on a single dashboard page layout, creating a powerful visual display and a way to consume multiple reports that often have a common theme, like sales performance, customer support, etc.\nLike reports, dashboards are stored in folders, which control who has access. If you have access to a folder, you can view its dashboards. However, to view the dashboard components, you need access to the underlying reports as well. You can also follow a dashboard in Chatter to get updates about the dashboard posted to your feed.\nEach dashboard has a running user, whose security settings determine which data to display in a dashboard. If the running user is a specific user, all dashboard viewers see data based on the security settings of that user—regardless of their own personal security settings. For this reason, you’ll want to choose the running user wisely, so as not to open up too much visibility. For example, set the Recruitment Coordinator as the running user for a dashboard for her team. This allows her team members to view the dashboard for their individual team, but not other teams.\nDynamic dashboards are dashboards for which the running user is always the logged-in user. This way, each user sees the dashboard according to his or her own access level. If you’re concerned about too much access, dynamic dashboards might be the way to go.")]),e._v(" "),a("h3",{attrs:{id:"what-is-a-report-type"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#what-is-a-report-type"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" "),a("strong",[e._v("What is a report type?")])]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("A report type is like a template which makes reporting easier.
