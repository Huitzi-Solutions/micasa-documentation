**Difficulty:** Beginner.

### **Why Support Alerts?**

Creating Support Alerts in Salesforce allows you to request any type of Salesforce support you might need. This includes the Salesforce-connected tools that we use, such as Form Assembly for online forms and Mogli SMS for texting. By centralizing support requests as Support Alerts in Salesforce, you’re able to easily track the Support Alerts you’ve submitted, their statuses, and their resolutions. You can also see all the Support Alerts submitted across the agency, and may even be able to find the information you need in a completed Support Alert.

### **Support Type Examples**

- **Duplicate:** You found duplicate records in Salesforce for a person/registration/partner/business, etc and need them merged

- **Deletion:** You made a mistake creating a course/class, found a spam response, or created a test record and need it deleted

- **Bug Report:** Something isn’t working correctly! Things could be things like formulas not working, data missing, error messages, not being able to find a record, etc

- **Existing Form Change:** An existing registration or data entry form needs updates. This includes fields being added or removed, courses or staff members being updated, typos, or changes to how data connects to Salesforce.

::: warning Note:

**New links for webinars or any other online form needs involving marketing/website calendar updates should continue to be requested via email to the entire Program Support Team.**
:::

- **Report/Dashboard Request:** You need a report/dashboard created or updated, or you need support using an existing report/dashboard. This includes “How can I see **\_\_**” requests

- **Functionality Request:** Salesforce needs to do something it isn’t currently doing. This includes new fields, page layout changes, automations, new buttons or actions, etc.

- **Training Request:** You need some additional Salesforce training! This includes individual or group/team training, general or content/object specific training, and written/visual/video training material requests.

- **Other:** What you need doesn’t fit into any of the above categories

### **Support Alert Priority**

The guidelines for Priority levels are below. 

**The Huitzi Solutions will adhere to these timeframes as much as possible** – the nature of some requests may require additional time due to information gathering, testing, or scheduling. You will be notified as soon as possible if your request cannot be completed in the designated time frame. If your request does not need to be completed within 5 business days, you can select Future and enter the date needed.

### **What Happens After Submitting A Support Alert?**

Your Support Alert status will be updated within 24 hours (or 1 business day) and **the Huitzi Solutions team will reach out if any additional information or details are needed.**

You can check the status of your Support Alerts at any point by using the My Support Alerts list at the top of your Salesforce Home Page. This list shows all Support Alerts you’ve submitted, including completed ones.

When your request has been completed, the Huizti Solutions team will update the Response or Resolution field, mark the Status as completed, and enter the Resolved Date. You will receive an email notifying you that your Support Alert is complete. This email links directly to the Support Alert record, where you can review Response or Resolution information.

#### **Support Alert Lists**

My Support Alerts is a list at the top of your Salesforce Home Page. This list allows you to see all Support Alerts you’ve submitted, along with the Created Date, Status, Priority, and Resolved Date for each one.

To view Support Alerts submitted by others, open the Support Alerts tab on your navigation bar. You may need to use the More arrow to find it. Then click on the Recently Viewed arrow at the upper left of your screen to find additional lists. You can find lists grouped by teams, Support Type, or Status. This allows you to see what other Support Alerts are in the pipeline – and allows you to see if your issue/question has previously been answered.
