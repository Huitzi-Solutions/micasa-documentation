**Doc version:** 2020


### **Objective:**  
In this section you will find how to use the Data Request Form.


### **Where is it located?** 
| [Link to tfaforms](https://www.tfaforms.com/4774032)

**Difficulty:** Advanced.

The Data Request Form helps ensure that:

- you know what data is available to you
- you get all the data you need
- Kasey or the Huizti Solutions team can pull the data efficiently
-  the Program Support team can manage and prioritize data requests

### **Tips for using the Data Request Form:**
- Please submit your request at least 2 businesses days before you need to use/distribute data


- The form will give you additional options based on your selections – it starts big and narrows down


- If your request includes layers of breakdowns, please list the data points in order you’d like them broken down in the “anything else I should know” box at the bottom.
I.e., “industry by gender” would break down all gender categories within each industry; “gender by industry” would break down all industries within each gender category.

- Year to Date data is available, but data for current month/quarter may not be fully entered or cleaned. When possible, the most recent calendar year or “school year” (July 1 – June 30) will give the best current data set.

- Requests involving certain types of location data – neighborhoods, census tracts, political boundaries, and any self-defined boundaries – require an additional 1-2 business days to complete, because these participants must be mapped in order to refine the data set by the geographic constraints. The form will notify you of this if you select one of these categories.
If you need or would like a map to accompany your data, please make note in the “anything else I should know” box at the bottom

- If you need any data involving any previous programming, partners, or locations, please make note in the “anything else I should know” box. 

- As we continue to refine and expand evaluation at Mi Casa, the Data Request Form will be expanded and updated
