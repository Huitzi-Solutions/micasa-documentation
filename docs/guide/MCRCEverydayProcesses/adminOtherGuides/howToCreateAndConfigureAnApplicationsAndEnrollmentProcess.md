|[Mi Casa” | App | Sales Processes](https://micasa.lightning.force.com/lightning/setup/OpportunityProcess/home)

**Difficulty:** Advanced

The applications and enrollment process allows Mi Casa staff to keep track of participant’s status to join a course. In Salesforce, the applications and enrollments process can be found in the Sales processes due to native Salesforce functionality. It is possible to create and maintain multiple sales processes.

Usually, Sales processes use the opportunity stage field to identify the status of an opportunity within the sales lifecycle. Nevertheless, in Mi Casa, the Sales process is customized to track the status of applications and enrollments of participants in a course.

### **Here are the MCRC Sales Processes:**
