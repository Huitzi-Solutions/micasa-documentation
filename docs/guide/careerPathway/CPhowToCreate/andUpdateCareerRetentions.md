2. At the top of the participant’s Contact record use the “Click here to enter a new Career Retention” link. This link will open a new tab. The participant’s name will be prefilled, and you will enter the remaining appointment information – including the type of post-participation Career Retention. 



3. Hit “Submit”. Here is what happened: Salesforce created a Career Coaching appointment under the Career Coaching 2019 course.

6. Once you’ve entered the employment or education/training information, click Submit. When you submit, the following things happen:

Salesforce creates a Career Retention Form, which will be the link between all of this participant’s Career Retention Appointments.

Salesforce creates an Initial Career Retention Appointment, connected to the Career Retention Form.

7. Return to the open tab with the participant’s Contact record and refresh your browser page. Click on the Related tab, and in the Forms tile at the top, find the Career Retention form you just created. Click on the form name (Form-####) to open the Career Retention form.

8. In the Career Retention form record, you should see the Initial retention appointment in the center of the page, along with a section of dates and the employment or education/training information in the sidebar on the right.

Click on the “Schedule Employment Retention appointments” link at the top of the page.

9. This will open the follow-up appointment scheduler form. The Participant Information box will prefill the participant’s name, Career Retention Type, Job Start Date or Education/Training Start Date and Training Type. The Training Type then determines which follow-up appointments will be scheduled.

All New Employment retentions will show a 1 Week box with information about a scheduled automated check-in text. If the 1 Week date has already passed or the participant has opted out of receiving texts, the form will notify you and will not schedule the text. You can also change the scheduled date or opt out of (skip) the text if needed.

For all applicable follow-up points, please review the scheduled date and staff members, and adjust if needed (for example: to avoid a weekend/holiday or staff vacation). You can also add notes to any appointments.

10. When you’ve reviewed the applicable text and/or appointment information, click Submit. This will schedule the 1 Week Check-In text, if applicable, and create Scheduled retention appointments for all applicable follow-up points.

**Updating Scheduled Appointments**

1. To update 2, 3, 6, or 12 month follow-up appointments, return to the participant’s Contact record. Go to the Related tab and open their Career Retention form by clicking on the Form Name (Form-####) listed in the form tile at the top. (See image in Step 4 above). Once you’ve opened the Career Retention Form record, select the appointment you need to edit by click on the Appointment Number (0003####) for the correct Verification Point.
