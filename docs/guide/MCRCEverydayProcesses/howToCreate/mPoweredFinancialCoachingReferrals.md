## ... mPowered Financial Coaching Referrals

**Doc version:** 2017

### **Objective:**  

In this section you will find how to Create mPowered Financial Coaching Referrals

### **Where is it located within the Salesforce Org?**

Navigation inside the Org. E.G[Mi Casa App/Contacts/MariaJoseTamayo/Applications&Enrollments](https://micasa.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Contact/0032M00003AyyzYQAR/view)

**Difficulty:** Beginner.

### **Steps:**

#### 1. Go to the Participant Contact’s <u>Enrollment Record</u>

  a. To find a participant enrollment record you can:

      1.  Search for the participant name in the global search box and click on the participant’s appropriate <u>Enrollment Record.</u>

      2.  Go to your Program’s Account Page, and search for the appropriate course. Once in the course navigate to the <u>Related Link</u> and scroll down to <From>Applications & Enrollments.

      3.  From here select “View All” and click on the appropriate <u>Enrollment Record.

#### 2. At the top right corner of the participant <u>Enrollment Record</u>  you will see a button that says “Mpowered Appointment Referral”. Select this button.

    You will be prompted to enter:

    a. Contact Name

    b. Appointment Start Date/Time

    c. mPowered Financial Coach

    d. Appointment Status is automatically set to “Scheduled”—**do not change this.**

#### 3. Hit “Save”. Here is what happened:

    a. Salesforce created a mPowered Financial Coaching Appointment Shell containing the data you entered.
    
    b. Salesforce sent an email to the Financial Coach you associated with the appointment. Below is a sample of the email sent to mPowered financial coaches:
