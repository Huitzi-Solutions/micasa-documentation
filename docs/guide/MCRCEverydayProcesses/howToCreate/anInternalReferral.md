3. The Create New MCRC Referral box will auto-populate the participant’s name, Date of Interaction as today’s date, and the Partnerships Name. After you click on this button, a screen will open where you will need to add the following information:
  a. **Internal Referral Account:** the program or service that you’re referring the participant to. This is limited to the following Program and high-level Course accounts: Business Program, Career Program, ProBoPat Program, Financial Services Pathway, Legal Clinic, or Business Legal Night

  b. **MCRC Staff Referred To:** the name  of the staff member that you’re referring the participant to.

  c. **Referral Notes:** any information that the other staff members need to know about the participant. For example, the reason why you’re referring them to a course, their participation history, the goals/interests, etc.

4. **Click Save.** This will keep you on the participant’s Contact record, but a green box will appear to confirm the Internal Referral was created. The underlined words in this box are a link to the new Internal Referral record. You can click on this link if you need or want to view the referral details to conduct tasks such as uploading a file, update notes, etc.

## <u>**How to Manage Internal Referral**</u>

1. The My Open Internal Referrals list view is at the top of your Salesforce Home Page. This shows all your Internal Referral records (referrals that have been made to you) that have a New or Open status.

2. Click on the Partnership Name to open the referral record. Here you can see any notes that the referring staff member added.

3. Once you’ve reviewed a new referral, change the Status to “Open”. This will help distinguish between referrals that have been viewed/received and those that are brand new.

1. Any applicable files/documents can be uploaded to the Files tile on the right sidebar. You can also add Notes records here. Additionally, you can email the participant or log a call on the referral record. When logging a call, the Internal Referral record will automatically be attached to the logged call.

**Important note:** you should also add the participant’s Contact in the Name box to ensure the call is connected to their Contact as well.
