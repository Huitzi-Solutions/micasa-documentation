2. The Activity feed defaults to Tasks. Click on the Email option in the Activity feed to send an email.

3. You will automatically be added as the sender. The Contact whose record youâ€™re on will auto-populate in the To field. If needed, click the CC and/or BCC button to add those fields, and add the appropriate Contacts/emails to those fields.

4. Enter a Subject.

5. Type the body of your email.

6. Below the email body, you will see a Related To field. This will automatically default to the Record (Application/Appointment/Course/etc) that you are emailing from.

7. Below the Related To field are a few icons. The first, a paperclip, is how you can attach documents. If you prefer a larger view of the email, you can click on the far right icon, a square with an arrow. This will create a pop up window for the email.

8. When finished, click the Send button.
