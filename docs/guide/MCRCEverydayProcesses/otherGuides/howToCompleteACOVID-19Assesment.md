- This will open your call list for the assessment. Please ensure that the words “My Assessment Call List” appears towards the upper left of your screen, just to the right of the purple square icon -- circled in red in the image below. If not, please contact Kasey Herndon or the Huitzi Solutions team at salesforce@micasaresourcecenter.org before moving on to other steps.

- Your **Assessment Call List shows six different fields (columns)**: Participant Name, an Assessment Completed checkbox, participant’s Primary Language, Primary Phone number, Email address, and an Assessment Notes area. To sort your list by any of these fields, click on the word at the top of the column.  The or arrows indicate the order (ascending or descending).

- To make a call, click on a name in the Name column of your list. This will open the participant’s Contact record.

- The top section of the **Contact record**, after the yellow arrow icon, is called **COVID-19 Assessment Details**. From this section, select either the **Business or Career assessment** by clicking the **“Click here to complete a Business COVID-19 Assessment”** link on the left (circled in red above) or the **“Click here to complete a Career COVID-19 Assessment”** link on the right (circled in green above).
This will open the assessment form in a new browser tab.

- When the assessment opens, it shows the participant’s name, phone number, and primary language in boxes at the top. This is for your reference and it cannot be edited.

Some participants might not have a primary language listed. This is not out of the ordinary at the time being. You will, however, need to determine once they answer the call which language they prefer.

- To see your script and question, select English or Spanish. Please select the additional language choice before filling out any further questions.

Use the phone number listed in the Primary Phone Number box to call the participant.

**If the participant does not answer their phone, or you are unable to get a hold of them** (wrong number, left a message, number not in service, etc), **close this browser tab and skip to step 13.**

- Follow the script provided, filling your name into the blank in the first line.
> > > All text with *** and italics – such as ***Listen*** -- are directions for you.
> > > Every field is required.

If the participant gives an answer that isn’t covered by the provided choices, select Other and write their answer in the text box that appears. 

If the participant declines to answer a question, select Other and write “Did not answer” in the text box.

- Any additional information the participant provides should be entered in the “Is there anything else that I should know?” box.

- When you’ve answered all the questions and completed the conversation, click the purple Submit button. When you see the “Thank you. Your response has been processed successfully” message, you can close this browser tab and return to the participant’s Contact record tab.

- On the participant’s Contact record, refresh your browser. This will show the Assessment Completed box checked (circled in red below). Checking this box will remove the participant from your call list.

- If needed, add any notes about the call by clicking on the gray pencil to the right of the Assessment Notes box (circled in green above). 

> > > If you spoke to the participant on your first attempt and nothing about the call was noteworthy, you can leave this box empty.

> > > **If you were unable to talk to the participant, please make a note of that in the Assessment Notes box, and include the date and time that you attempted to reach the participant.** This will help you keep track of call attempts, as well as determine who in your call list you have or have not attempted to reach.

- Once the assessment has been completed or attempts to reach have been noted, you can move on to the next participant on your list. 

Click on the Contact header at the top of your screen – this should be highlighted, if you’re still on the previous participant’s Contact record. Repeat steps 3-14 to move through your call list.

- If you have made notes about attempts to contact, they will appear on the far right side of your call list. This will alert you that an attempt(s) has been made, but that you haven’t been successful. Anyone whose Assessment Completed checkbox has been checked will no longer appear in your call list.
