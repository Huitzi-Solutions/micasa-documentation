**Doc version:** 2020

### **Objective:**

**Difficulty:** Advanced.

### **Steps:**

3. Frequently when you create a new report, there will not be any records shown. However, on the left sidebar, you can choose filters that will show the data that you need.

For example, if we wanted a report for course enrollment, we would first choose the Add Filter option, then Application & Enrollment Record Type and then Course Enrollment in the sub-list. A visual of this can be seen in the image below.

Several filters are available to create a report and it is easier to search for them through the search bar. For reports, you can add as many filters as you need; nevertheless, it is recommended to look for filters that have details in common.

4. When you finish, you can click in the bottom Save & Run.

5. A good practice is to give the report a specific name in order to avoid any confusion. You can also choose the folder where you are going to save the report as shown in the image below.
