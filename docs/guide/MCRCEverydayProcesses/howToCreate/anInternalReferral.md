##An Internal Referral

**Doc Version**: 2021
**Objective**:  In this section you will find how to create an internal referral of a participant to one of Mi Casa’s programs. 
**Where is it located within the Salesforce Org?**  [Mi Casa” | App | Contact](https://micasa--partial.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Contact/list?filterName=Recent)
**Difficulty**: Beginner

**Steps:**
Begin by searching in the global search bar (the Search Salesforce box at the top of your screen) for the participant– either by part of their name or the last 4 digits of their phone number. This ensures you avoid any search issues due to nicknames, misspellings, married/divorced names, double last names, etc. **(image 2.30)**
