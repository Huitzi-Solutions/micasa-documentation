Click on the arrow next to the Accounts tab (shaped like a v)</p>\n<p>b. Select + New Account</p>\n<p>c. Select Partner Directory as the record type and click Next</p>\n<p>d. Enter the organization or company name in the Account Name, as it appears on the company website. Do not use acronyms or a portion of the name, unless adding to the end of the full name – for example, “Community College or Aurora (CCA)”. Using acronyms or nicknames creates confusion in the system and we run the risk of having more than one account for the same company. Examples:</p>\n<div><pre><code>  i. “Partner Colorado Credit Union” rather than “Partner”\n\n  ii. “Denver Public Schools” rather than “DPS”\n</code></pre>\n</div><p>e.

Click Save</p>\n<h3 id=\"adding-partner-contacts\"> <strong>Adding Partner Contacts</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Individuals who work at partner organizations have Partner Contact records in Salesforce. To search for an individual, first go to the Partner Account for their organization. Open the Related tab and then click View All in the Contacts tile. This will show you all Partner Contacts connected to that Account.\nYou can also search the individual's name in the Global Search Bar – they may already exist in Salesforce, connected to a previous employer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you search and the individual is not listed, go to the organization’s Account.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>a. Select “New” in the Contacts section</p>\n<p>b. Select Partner as the record type and click Next</p>\n<p>c. Fill in as much information as you can – Name, Title, Email, and Phone are particularly important to capture</p>\n<p>d. Under Partner Type select the Mi Casa program/department this individual partners with</p>\n<p>e. Under Partner Status, select the individual’s current status as an MCRC partner</p>\n<p>f. Check the Employer Partner box if this individual is an employer partner</p>\n<p>g. Choose the applicable Type of Practitioner if this individual is a patent practitioner</p>\n<p>h. Skip the ProBoPat Hours and ProBoPat Volunteer Information sections</p>\n<p>i. Click Save</p>\n<p>Emails to/from Partner Contacts should be logged to Salesforce directly from Outlook. You can also send emails from their Partner Contact in Salesforce – this has the added advantage of seeing if/when the recipient has opened the email. Logging emails/calls with Partner Contacts helps us streamline communication with partners and collaborate better across Mi Casa.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adding-tracking-partner-engagements\"> <strong>Adding/Tracking Partner Engagements</strong></h3>\n<p>Just like work with our participants, it should be our practice to <strong>document all partner engagement!</strong> This gives us a clear picture of the ways that we are engaging with our partners and they are engaging with us! Please note there are multiple ways to enter partner engagements, but the steps below should be the standard method.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Search for and open the Partner Account for the organization or company. (If not found, see above steps to create Partner Account for the organization)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on the Related tab to open the lists of connected records</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scroll down to the Partner Engagements tile and select New.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select Partner Engagement as the record type and click Next.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ensure that the correct Account is auto-filled in the Partner Organization – this should be the Partner Account you opened in step 1.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add “Partner Engagement” to the Partnership Name box. (Note: Salesforce will auto-update the Partnership Name once you hit Save)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Search for the name of the individual from the organization or company that engaged or interacted with Mi Casa in the Partner Contact box.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div><pre><code>a.

Informational Meeting: use for first time meeting or meetings about the partnership\n\ne. Attended Graduation: use for a partner who speaks at or attends graduation\n\nf. Offered employment to Mi Casa graduate: use if we know an employer partner offered employment to a participant and the participant elected not to take the job. (Note: Hired Mi Casa graduate engagements do not need to be entered manually, as they are auto-created upon entering initial Career Retentions).\n</code></pre>\n</div><ol start=\"12\">\n<li>\n<p>Enter any applicable notes in the Partner Engagement Notes box. This could include the guest speaker topic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click Save</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter a new Partner Engagement for each person who engages- for example, if two people present as guest speakers, enter two different engagements\na.

      "content_html": "<p><strong>Doc Version:</strong> 2017</p>\n<h2 id=\"objective\"> <strong>Objective:</strong></h2>\n<p>In this section you will find the basic theory about the reports and dashboards in Salesforce.</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Beginner.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-report\"> <strong>What is a report?</strong></h3>\n<p>A report is a list of records that meet the criteria you define. It’s displayed in Salesforce in rows and columns, and can be filtered, grouped, or displayed in a graphical chart.\nEvery report is stored in a folder. Folders can be public, hidden, or shared, and can be set to read-only or read/write. You control who has access to the contents of the folder based on roles, permissions, public groups, and license types. You can make a folder available to your entire organization, or make it private so that only you, as the owner, have access.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-dashboard\"> <strong>What is a dashboard?</strong></h3>\n<p>A dashboard is a visual display of key metrics and trends for records in your org. The relationship between a dashboard component and report is 1:1; for each dashboard component, there is a single underlying report. However, you can use the same report in multiple dashboard components on a single dashboard (e.g., use the same report in both a bar chart and pie chart). Multiple dashboard components can be shown together on a single dashboard page layout, creating a powerful visual display and a way to consume multiple reports that often have a common theme, like sales performance, customer support, etc.\nLike reports, dashboards are stored in folders, which control who has access. If you have access to a folder, you can view its dashboards. However, to view the dashboard components, you need access to the underlying reports as well. You can also follow a dashboard in Chatter to get updates about the dashboard posted to your feed.\nEach dashboard has a running user, whose security settings determine which data to display in a dashboard. If the running user is a specific user, all dashboard viewers see data based on the security settings of that user—regardless of their own personal security settings. For this reason, you’ll want to choose the running user wisely, so as not to open up too much visibility. For example, set the Recruitment Coordinator as the running user for a dashboard for her team. This allows her team members to view the dashboard for their individual team, but not other teams.\nDynamic dashboards are dashboards for which the running user is always the logged-in user. This way, each user sees the dashboard according to his or her own access level. If you’re concerned about too much access, dynamic dashboards might be the way to go.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-report-type\"> <strong>What is a report type?</strong></h3>\n<p>A report type is like a template which makes reporting easier. The report type determines which fields and records are available for use when creating a report. This is based on the relationships between a primary object and its related objects. For example, with the ‘Contacts and Accounts’ report type, ‘Contacts’ is the primary object and ‘Accounts’ is the related object.\nReports display only records that meet the criteria defined in the report type. Out of the box, Salesforce provides a set of predefined standard report types. Don’t see all the fields you want? Your administrator might need to create a custom report type.</p>\n<p>For example, an administrator can create a report type that shows only job applications that have an associated resume; applications without resumes won't show up in reports using that type. An administrator can also show records that may have related records—for example, applications with or without a welcome form. In this case, all applications, whether or not they have a welcome form, are available to reports using that type. An administrator can also add fields from a related object by creating a lookup relationship to that object, allowing for even more reporting possibilities.</p>\n<img :src=\"$withBase('/assets/reportsAndDashboardsBasicGuide/1.png')\" alt=\"foo\">\n<p>An image showing the relationships between folders, dashboards, reports, and report types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"let-s-build-a-report\"> <strong>Let's build a report!</strong></h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type of information</th>\n<th>Examples</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Main Question</td>\n<td>Where do our program participants come from?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Follow-up Questions</td>\n<td>- What type of program participants should be included in the report (alumni who have successfully completed the program, participants with Spanish as their primary language, etc)? - Do you want to see the results grouped by city, country, or Zip Code? - What is your date range?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Requirements</td>\n<td>- 'Program Participants' excludes prospects who did not enroll in a program. - Group participants by Race/Ethnicity. - Show all Closed/Won Applications &amp; Enrollments*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Criteria</td>\n<td>- Report Type = Applications &amp; Enrollments w/Class Participations and Contact. - Report Format = Summary - Grouping = Zip Code - Show = My Team's Applications &amp; Enrollments  - Date Field = Close Date - Range = All Time - Filter = Stage 'equals' Completed - Filter = City 'equals' Denver - Filter Logic = 1 AND 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

This includes the Salesforce-connected tools that we use, such as Form Assembly for online forms and Mogli SMS for texting. By centralizing support requests as Support Alerts in Salesforce, you’re able to easily track the Support Alerts you’ve submitted, their statuses, and their resolutions. You can also see all the Support Alerts submitted across the agency, and may even be able to find the information you need in a completed Support Alert.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-type-examples\"> <strong>Support Type Examples</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Duplicate:</strong> You found duplicate records in Salesforce for a person/registration/partner/business, etc and need them merged</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deletion:</strong> You made a mistake creating a course/class, found a spam response, or created a test record and need it deleted</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bug Report:</strong> Something isn’t working correctly! Things could be things like formulas not working, data missing, error messages, not being able to find a record, etc</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Existing Form Change:</strong> An existing registration or data entry form needs updates. This includes fields being added or removed, courses or staff members being updated, typos, or changes to how data connects to Salesforce.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><p>Note:</p>\n<p><strong>New links for webinars or any other online form needs involving marketing/website calendar updates should continue to be requested via email to the entire Program Support Team.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Report/Dashboard Request:</strong> You need a report/dashboard created or updated, or you need support using an existing report/dashboard. This includes “How can I see <strong>__</strong>” requests</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Functionality Request:</strong> Salesforce needs to do something it isn’t currently doing. This includes new fields, page layout changes, automations, new buttons or actions, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Training Request:</strong> You need some additional Salesforce training! This includes individual or group/team training, general or content/object specific training, and written/visual/video training material requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Other:</strong> What you need doesn’t fit into any of the above categories</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"support-alert-priority\"> <strong>Support Alert Priority</strong></h3>\n<p>The guidelines for Priority levels are below.</p>\n<p><strong>The Huitzi Solutions will adhere to these timeframes as much as possible</strong> – the nature of some requests may require additional time due to information gathering, testing, or scheduling. You will be notified as soon as possible if your request cannot be completed in the designated time frame. If your request does not need to be completed within 5 business days, you can select Future and enter the date needed.</p>\n<img :src=\"$withBase('/assets/supportAlertIntroduction/1.jpg')\" alt=\"foo\">\n<h3 id=\"what-happens-after-submitting-a-support-alert\"> <strong>What Happens After Submitting A Support Alert?</strong></h3>\n<p>Your Support Alert status will be updated within 24 hours (or 1 business day) and <strong>the Huitzi Solutions team will reach out if any additional information or details are needed.</strong></p>\n<p>You can check the status of your Support Alerts at any point by using the My Support Alerts list at the top of your Salesforce Home Page. This list shows all Support Alerts you’ve submitted, including completed ones.</p>\n<p>When your request has been completed, the Huizti Solutions team will update the Response or Resolution field, mark the Status as completed, and enter the Resolved Date. You will receive an email notifying you that your Support Alert is complete. This email links directly to the Support Alert record, where you can review Response or Resolution information.</p>\n<h4 id=\"support-alert-lists\"> <strong>Support Alert Lists</strong></h4>\n<p>My Support Alerts is a list at the top of your Salesforce Home Page. This list allows you to see all Support Alerts you’ve submitted, along with the Created Date, Status, Priority, and Resolved Date for each one.</p>\n<p>To view Support Alerts submitted by others, open the Support Alerts tab on your navigation bar. You may need to use the More arrow to find it. Then click on the Recently Viewed arrow at the upper left of your screen to find additional lists. You can find lists grouped by teams, Support Type, or Status. This allows you to see what other Support Alerts are in the pipeline – and allows you to see if your issue/question has previously been answered.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p><strong>Doc version:</strong> 2021</p>\n<h1 id=\"process-builders\"> <strong>Process Builders</strong></h1>\n<p>Process Builder is a tool in Salesforce that is commonly used to automate processes such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create records,</li>\n<li>Update a record,</li>\n<li>Submit a record for approval,</li>\n<li>Send emails using specified email templates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"anatomy-of-a-process\"> <strong>Anatomy of a Process</strong></h2>\n<p>Every process consists of a trigger, at least one criteria node, and at least one action. You can configure inmediat actions or scheduled actions to be executed at a specific time.\nHere is an example of a simple process:</p>\n<img :src=\"$withBase('/assets/processBuilders/anatomyProcessBuilder.png')\" alt=\"foo\">\n<ol>\n<li>Parent Object: Every process builder needs to start by making reference to a parent object. This object will make available the data that will be used in the process. For example, the process shown in the diagram above will make data from the opportunity object available to use in the process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additionally, Process Builder will attach a trigger to the object, which will determine when the process should run. There are two options for triggers that can be chosen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only when a record is created</li>\n<li>Anytime a record is created or edited</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Criteria: In process builder, it is possible to add as many criteria nodes as desired. Each criteria node controls whether or not the process executes the associated actions. If the record doesn’t meet the criteria, the process skips those actions and moves on to the next criteria node in the process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In each criteria node, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set filter conditions.</li>\n<li>Enter a custom formula. Like in validation rules, the formula must resolve to true or false.</li>\n<li>Opt out of criteria and always execute the associated actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p>Immediate Actions: If the record meets the conditions defined on the criteria, all the actions defined on this section will be executed immediately. For example, if all the criteria is met, the process will email a draft of a contract to a set of email addresses immediately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scheduled Actions: If the record meets the conditions defined on the criteria, all the actions defined on this section will be executed at the scheduled time. For example, if all the criteria is met, the process will send a reminder to a set of email addresses after 6 days.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
