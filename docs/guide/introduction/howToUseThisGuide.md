## How to use this documentation

This guide is intended to inform Salesforce users, administrators, and developers of the current configuration, features, and automations active in Mi Casaâ€™s Salesforce org. This is meant to be a living document where every change, addition and/or update to the org will be documented.

 \
Initially, this guide will have four additional parts: MCRC Everyday Process; Career Pathway; Business Pathway and Third Party Integrations. Furthermore, the guides will be divided into three profiles: users, administrators and developers. 

In addition, as part of the version control, each subsection has the modification date, description of the objective, the explanation of the location and the difficulty of the activity.
