<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Advanced.</p>
<h3 id="steps"> <strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click on Reports in the Navigation Bar. In case you can’t see it, please click the More option in the Navigation Bar to display a dropdown menu. Upon click, a menu will appear with an option called Reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the top of the page, click New Report. Then choose the Report Type and choose the objects that you are going to use. For example, as shown in the image below, you can choose Contacts with Applications &amp; Enrollments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/anEnrollmentReport/1.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="3">
<li>Frequently when you create a new report, there will not be any records shown. However, on the left sidebar, you can choose filters that will show the data that you need.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/anEnrollmentReport/2.png')" alt="foo">
<p>For example, if we wanted a report for course enrollment, we would first choose the Add Filter option, then Application &amp; Enrollment Record Type and then Course Enrollment in the sub-list. A visual of this can be seen in the image below.</p>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/anEnrollmentReport/3.png')" alt="foo">
<p>Several filters are available to create a report and it is easier to search for them through the search bar. For reports, you can add as many filters as you need; nevertheless, it is recommended to look for filters that have details in common.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>When you finish, you can click in the bottom Save &amp; Run.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/anEnrollmentReport/4.png')" alt="foo">
5. A good practice is to give the report a specific name in order to avoid any confusion. You can also choose the folder where you are going to save the report as shown in the image below.

<p><strong>Doc version:</strong> 2019</p>
<h3 id="objective"> <strong>Objective:</strong></h3>
<p>In this section you will find how to convert a prospect when they enroll in one of Mi Casa’s courses.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-it-located-within-the-salesforce-org"> <strong>Where is it located within the Salesforce Org?</strong></h3>
<p>| Navigation inside the Org. <a href="https://micasa--partial.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Lead/list?filterName=Recent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mi Casa” | App | Prospect</a></p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Beginner</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the Prospect record you wish to convert, either through the search bar, using your List Views within the Prospect object, or a Related List on the course record.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/howToConvertAProspect/1.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="2">
<li>Ensure that all relevant information has been entered. Most importantly, <strong>make sure that a Course has been entered.</strong> Without a Course, the Prospect record cannot be converted.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/howToConvertAProspect/2.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="3">
<li>Either select Converted in the progress bar across the top of the Prospect record and then click the blue Select Converted Prospect Status box next to it, or click the Convert button at the top right of the Prospect record. Both methods do the same thing.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/howToConvertAProspect/3.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>When the Convert Prospect screen appears, there will be 3 sections – the first for Account, the second for Contact, and the third for Application &amp; Enrollment. You will never need to pay attention to, touch, edit, or do anything else with the Account section or the Application &amp; Enrollment section (see Prospect FAQ’s for more information, if curious). The system is set up to do specific things for those objects, regardless of what you edit on the Convert Prospect screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should, however, pay close attention to the Contact section.  Salesforce will search all the Contacts in our system to figure out if there is already a Contact that matches the information for this Prospect. If it finds one (or more), the existing Contact will display on the right side of the screen. To see more info on the existing Contact, click the Choose Existing circle. If the contact is the same (verify through contact info), select the circle on the tile for that Contact.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If Salesforce doesn’t present a Contact match, but you think there might be one anyway, you can search in the “Search for matching contacts” box. This can happen if the emails differ between the Prospect and existing Contact, or if the last names differ (for example, two last names on the Contact are listed as a middle name and last name on the Prospect).</strong></p>
<p><strong>If there's a Prospect that is not otherwise in Salesforce, the Contact section can remain on the Create New option on the left side.</strong></p>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/howToConvertAProspect/4.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="6">
<li>Once the appropriate selection has been made for Contacts, click the Convert button. The following screen will show you and link you to the Account, Contact, and Application &amp; Enrollment records that have been created (and/or merged, in the case of Contacts) from the Prospect. When a prospect has been converted successfully, a pop-up like the one shown in the image below will show.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/howToConvertAProspect/5.png')" alt="foo">
<h2 id="faqs"> <strong>FAQs.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q. What happens when you convert a Prospect?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> Salesforce splits the single Prospect record into separate but connected Account (Household), Contact, and Application &amp; Enrollment (Registration) records. Each field on the Prospect is mapped to go to a specific field on the new Contact or Application &amp; Enrollment record.</p>
<p><strong>Q. When should you convert a Prospect?</strong>
A. When a prospective participant has been accepted into the training/program to which they’ve applied. This step essentially registers them for the training/program – they will later be enrolled in Salesforce once they’ve attended.</p>
<div><p>Note</p>
<p>Coaching/consulting Prospects should be converted after attending the initial appointment.</p>

<h3 id="steps"> <strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the participant’s Contact record.</li>
<li>Click on the Create New MCRC Referral button at the upper right of the page.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/anInternalRferral/1.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="3">
<li>The Create New MCRC Referral box will auto-populate the participant’s name, Date of Interaction as today’s date, and the Partnerships Name. After you click on this button, a screen will open where you will need to add the following information:
a. <strong>Internal Referral Account:</strong> the program or service that you’re referring the participant to. This is limited to the following Program and high-level Course accounts: Business Program, Career Program, ProBoPat Program, Financial Services Pathway, Legal Clinic, or Business Legal Night</li>
</ol>
<p>b. <strong>MCRC Staff Referred To:</strong> the name  of the staff member that you’re referring the participant to.</p>
<p>c. <strong>Referral Notes:</strong> any information that the other staff members need to know about the participant. For example, the reason why you’re referring them to a course, their participation history, the goals/interests, etc.</p>
  <img :src="$withBase('/assets/anInternalRferral/2.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Click Save.</strong> This will keep you on the participant’s Contact record, but a green box will appear to confirm the Internal Referral was created. The underlined words in this box are a link to the new Internal Referral record.

<li>The My Open Internal Referrals list view is at the top of your Salesforce Home Page. This shows all your Internal Referral records (referrals that have been made to you) that have a New or Open status.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/anInternalRferral/3.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Click on the Partnership Name to open the referral record. Here you can see any notes that the referring staff member added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you’ve reviewed a new referral, change the Status to “Open”. This will help distinguish between referrals that have been viewed/received and those that are brand new.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/anInternalRferral/4.png')" alt="foo">
<ol>
<li>Any applicable files/documents can be uploaded to the Files tile on the right sidebar. You can also add Notes records here. Additionally, you can email the participant or log a call on the referral record. When logging a call, the Internal Referral record will automatically be attached to the logged call.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>Warning</p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> you should also add the participant’s Contact in the Name box to ensure the call is connected to their Contact as well.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Beginner.</p>
<ol>
<li>From your home page, search the participant’s name in the global search bar. Click on the participant’s Contact or Prospect.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/aSingleSMS/1.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="2">
<li>Once in the Contact or Prospect, ensure that the participant has a phone number in the Mogli Number field. If not, you will need to edit the Contact to add the primary phone/mobile number into the Mogli Number field. There should also (in most cases) be one of 3 options in the Default Gateway field – Business Pathways, Career Pathways, or Program Support. This determines which phone number texts are sent from – this can be overridden later if needed.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/aSingleSMS/2.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="3">
<li>On the right sidebar, find the Mogli SMS component. You may need to scroll down, if the participant has an extensive history in Activity Tracking. In the “Message to send…” box, at the top of the bottom section, type your message.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>Note</p>
<p><strong>When typing your message, hitting enter (or shift-enter) will send the message.</strong></p>
</div>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/aSingleSMS/3.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="4">
<li>There are a few additional options for sending your message:</li>
</ol>
<p>a. If you’d like to override the Default Gateway, you can do so by selecting from the dropdown list next to the <img :src="$withBase('/assets/aSingleSMS/4.png')" alt="foo"> icon. This can be useful if participants are involved in multiple programs at a time – a Business training participant attending a Career workshop, or a Career training participant attending a Legal Clinic, etc.
b. If you’d like to use a template rather than writing your own message, you can select your desired template from the dropdown list next to the <img :src="$withBase('/assets/aSingleSMS/5.png')" alt="foo"> icon.
c. If you’d like to send this message at some point in the future, you can select the date and time from the boxes next to the <img :src="$withBase('/assets/aSingleSMS/6.png')" alt="foo"> and <img :src="$withBase('/assets/aSingleSMS/7.png')" alt="foo"> icons.</p>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/aSingleSMS/8.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="5">
<li>When you’re finished with your message, hit the red arrow (<img :src="$withBase('/assets/aSingleSMS/9.png')" alt="foo">) to send the message. Your message will appear in red, with your initials in the gray circle to the right. Any response from the participant will appear in charcoal, with their initials in the gray circle to the left.

<p><strong>Doc version:</strong> 2021</p>
<h3 id="objective"> <strong>Objective:</strong></h3>
<p>In this section you will find how to track and Manage Partner Engagement</p>
<h3 id="where-is-it-located-within-the-salesforce-org"> <strong>Where is it located within the Salesforce Org?</strong></h3>
<p>| Navigation inside the Org. E.G <a href="https://micasa.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Contact/0032M00003AyyzYQAR/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mi Casa App | Contacts | Related | Forms</a></p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Advanced.</p>
<p><u><strong>Adding Partner Organizations/Companies</strong></u></p>
<p>1.In the Global Search Bar, type the name of the organization or company and hit enter to view all search results.</p>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/andManagePartnerEngament/1.png')" alt="foo">
<p>2.If the company or organization is not in Salesforce, you can <strong>add a new Partner Account</strong></p>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/andManagePartnerEngament/2.png')" alt="foo">
<p>a. Click on the arrow next to the Accounts tab (shaped like a v)</p>
<p>b. Select + New Account</p>
<p>c. Select Partner Directory as the record type and click Next</p>
<p>d. Enter the organization or company name in the Account Name, as it appears on the company website. Do not use acronyms or a portion of the name, unless adding to the end of the full name – for example, “Community College or Aurora (CCA)”. Using acronyms or nicknames creates confusion in the system and we run the risk of having more than one account for the same company. Examples:</p>
<div><pre><code>  i. “Partner Colorado Credit Union” rather than “Partner”

  ii. “Denver Public Schools” rather than “DPS”
</code></pre>
</div><p>e. Under Status choose “Current Partner”</p>
<p>f. For Type of Organization, select the most accurate option.</p>
<p>g. If the organization or company is an employer partner, check the Employer Partner box</p>
<p>h. Add as much contact information for the organization as possible.</p>
<p>i. Skip the ProBoPat Hours section.</p>
<p>j. Click Save</p>
<h3 id="adding-partner-contacts"> <strong>Adding Partner Contacts</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Individuals who work at partner organizations have Partner Contact records in Salesforce. To search for an individual, first go to the Partner Account for their organization. Open the Related tab and then click View All in the Contacts tile. This will show you all Partner Contacts connected to that Account.
You can also search the individual's name in the Global Search Bar – they may already exist in Salesforce, connected to a previous employer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you search and the individual is not listed, go to the organization’s Account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. Select “New” in the Contacts section</p>
<p>b. Select Partner as the record type and click Next</p>
<p>c. Fill in as much information as you can – Name, Title, Email, and Phone are particularly important to capture</p>
<p>d. Under Partner Type select the Mi Casa program/department this individual partners with</p>
<p>e. Under Partner Status, select the individual’s current status as an MCRC partner</p>
<p>f. Check the Employer Partner box if this individual is an employer partner</p>
<p>g. Choose the applicable Type of Practitioner if this individual is a patent practitioner</p>
<p>h. Skip the ProBoPat Hours and ProBoPat Volunteer Information sections</p>
<p>i. Click Save</p>
<p>Emails to/from Partner Contacts should be logged to Salesforce directly from Outlook. You can also send emails from their Partner Contact in Salesforce – this has the added advantage of seeing if/when the recipient has opened the email. Logging emails/calls with Partner Contacts helps us streamline communication with partners and collaborate better across Mi Casa.</p>
<h3 id="adding-tracking-partner-engagements"> <strong>Adding/Tracking Partner Engagements</strong></h3>
<p>Just like work with our participants, it should be our practice to <strong>document all partner engagement!</strong> This gives us a clear picture of the ways that we are engaging with our partners and they are engaging with us! Please note there are multiple ways to enter partner engagements, but the steps below should be the standard method.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Search for and open the Partner Account for the organization or company. (If not found, see above steps to create Partner Account for the organization)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the Related tab to open the lists of connected records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scroll down to the Partner Engagements tile and select New.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Partner Engagement as the record type and click Next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the correct Account is auto-filled in the Partner Organization – this should be the Partner Account you opened in step 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add “Partner Engagement” to the Partnership Name box. (Note: Salesforce will auto-update the Partnership Name once you hit Save)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search for the name of the individual from the organization or company that engaged or interacted with Mi Casa in the Partner Contact box.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>a. See step 14 below if more than one individual
</code></pre>
</div><ol start="8">
<li>
<p>In general, the Participant can be left blank. If the partner interacted with an individual participant (ex. offered employment to a participant or joined a consulting appointment), search for that participant’s name in the Participant field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the Date of Interaction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the partner interacted with a training cohort or specific class (ex. as a guest speaker), search the Course/Class box for the specific course or class record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the appropriate Type of Engagement. Most common types of engagement:
a. Guest Speaker: use for a partner who shares in training/workshop</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>b. Interview Day: use for interview day or interview week for FST

c. Networking Event: use for Career Exploration Panel

d. Informational Meeting: use for first time meeting or meetings about the partnership

e. Attended Graduation: use for a partner who speaks at or attends graduation

f. Offered employment to Mi Casa graduate: use if we know an employer partner offered employment to a participant and the participant elected not to take the job. (Note: Hired Mi Casa graduate engagements do not need to be entered manually, as they are auto-created upon entering initial Career Retentions).
</code></pre>
</div><ol start="12">
<li>
<p>Enter any applicable notes in the Partner Engagement Notes box. This could include the guest speaker topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Save</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a new Partner Engagement for each person who engages- for example, if two people present as guest speakers, enter two different engagements
a. In this case of mock interviews or tours, leave the Partner Contact field blank and explain the reason in the Partner Engagement Notes.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Beginner.</p>
<h3 id="steps"> <strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From your Salesforce homepage, click on the Bulk SMS tab. It may be under the More <img :src="$withBase('/assets/bulkSMS/1.png')" alt="foo"> dropdown on the right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will load the Mogli Bulk SMS wizard. From here, you can choose to add Contacts or Leads individually – this could be helpful if you want to text just a couple participants the same thing – or you can add a Campaign.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/bulkSMS/2.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="3">
<li>To add a Campaign, search for it in the “Search Campaign…” box. This box will also auto-populate a list of your recently viewed Campaigns. Once you’ve selected the desired campaign, the SMS Recipients box at the upper right will populate the name and Mogli phone numbers of the Contacts or Leads associated with the Campaign. It will also give you a count of the total number of recipients.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/bulkSMS/3.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="4">
<li>Once your Contacts or Leads are loaded, you can either load an SMS Template or type your message in the box. You can also add a merge field from the drop down list – this will fill in a certain field from Salesforce to each participant – for example, if you want to send a personalized greeting to each recipient, you can use the Contact.FirstName! merge field to auto-fill each recipient’s first name.
This box also counts the number of characters you use. Keep in mind that some phone carriers may split messages into multiple texts after a certain number of characters (usually around 140 characters).</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/bulkSMS/4.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="5">
<li>The SMS Send Configuration box allows you to choose which phone number (Gateway) to send the message from, as well as schedule the text to be sent later. The Send From number should be the relevant program. If you want to send the text at a later date and/or time, select the specific date <img :src="$withBase('/assets/bulkSMS/5.png')" alt="foo"> and time <img :src="$withBase('/assets/bulkSMS/6.png')" alt="foo"> from the boxes.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/bulkSMS/7.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="6">
<li>Once your Campaign is selected, a message is written (or template is chosen), and Send Configuration is set, you can hit the blue Send box to send the message. A green “Bulk Group ID…” box will appear on your screen when the send is successful</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/bulkSMS/8.png')" alt="foo">
<h3 id="how-to-send-a-bulk-sms-from-a-list-view"> <strong>How to Send A Bulk SMS - From a List View</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>From the Salesforce home page, click on the Contacts (or Prospects) tab. In the Contacts object, click on the words Recently Viewed at the upper left to change the list view. Scroll or search for your desired list view.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/bulkSMS/9.jpg')" alt="foo">
<ol start="2">
<li>In the list view, select the box next to the Name column to select all contacts (alternatively, you can select certain Contacts or Prospects you’d like to text). Once the contacts are selected, click on the down arrow button at the upper right (next the Add to Campaign button) and select Send SMS Lightning.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/bulkSMS/10.jpg')" alt="foo">
<ol start="3">
<li>This will take you to the Bulk SMS page. The upper right box, SMS Recipients, lists everyone selected to receive the message. In the middle right box, SMS Message, type the desired message or choose an SMS Template from the dropdown list.
In the bottom right box, SMS Send Configuration, you can leave the Send From: box on Default (all Staff contacts are set to default to the Program Support/general number). If you want to schedule the message to send at a later point, you can select the date and time.
When finished entering the message, hit Send.</li>

<p><strong>d. Returned Late:</strong> the item has been returned and the Returned Date is after the Due Date</p>
<p><strong>e. DUE DATE NEEDED:</strong> the item is currently checked out (a Checkout Date is entered) but no Due Date has been entered.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>If a participant has previously borrowed a Chromebook and/or hotspot and is borrowing for a second (or more) time, you can overwrite the dates from the previous loan. When you do this, be sure to also erase the previous Returned Date when you add the Checkout Date and Due Date for the new loan – otherwise, the Status will be outdated.</li>

<h3 id="objective"> <strong>Objective:</strong></h3>
<p>In this section you will find how to use the Data Request Form.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-it-located"> <strong>Where is it located?</strong></h3>
<p>| <a href="https://www.tfaforms.com/4774032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link to tfaforms</a></p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Advanced.</p>
<p>The Data Request Form helps ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>you know what data is available to you</li>
<li>you get all the data you need</li>
<li>Kasey or the Huizti Solutions team can pull the data efficiently</li>
<li>the Program Support team can manage and prioritize data requests</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tips-for-using-the-data-request-form"> <strong>Tips for using the Data Request Form:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please submit your request at least 2 businesses days before you need to use/distribute data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The form will give you additional options based on your selections – it starts big and narrows down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your request includes layers of breakdowns, please list the data points in order you’d like them broken down in the “anything else I should know” box at the bottom.
I.e., “industry by gender” would break down all gender categories within each industry; “gender by industry” would break down all industries within each gender category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Year to Date data is available, but data for current month/quarter may not be fully entered or cleaned. When possible, the most recent calendar year or “school year” (July 1 – June 30) will give the best current data set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requests involving certain types of location data – neighborhoods, census tracts, political boundaries, and any self-defined boundaries – require an additional 1-2 business days to complete, because these participants must be mapped in order to refine the data set by the geographic constraints. The form will notify you of this if you select one of these categories.
If you need or would like a map to accompany your data, please make note in the “anything else I should know” box at the bottom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need any data involving any previous programming, partners, or locations, please make note in the “anything else I should know” box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we continue to refine and expand evaluation at Mi Casa, the Data Request Form will be expanded and updated</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Beginner.</p>
<h3 id="steps"> <strong>Steps</strong></h3>
<p>Go to a participant's Application &amp; Enrollment record.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Look at the top right corner of your screen for the button &quot;Clone&quot; and click on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that you have cloned the Application &amp; Enrollment record:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the field: &quot;Account Name&quot;. This is the current Application &amp; Enrollment record's Course Account. Click on the x in the Account Name field box, and type in the name of the new Course Account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the field: ‘Stage’. This is the current Application &amp; Enrollement’s stage, ensuring that the correct value is set for the new (cloned) Application &amp; Enrollment record.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-list-view-to-view-your-applications"> <strong>Create a “List View” to view your applications:</strong></h3>
<p>Go to <strong>Applications &amp; Enrollments:</strong> this tab automatically opens up to the “Recently Viewed” related list. Use the dropdown arrow next to “Recently Viewed” to select a related list that fits the description of what you are looking to pull—ex. “All Interest Forms”, “All Applications”, “All Enrollments”.</p>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/cloneAnApplicationOrEnrollmentRecord/2.jpg')" alt="foo">
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/cloneAnApplicationOrEnrollmentRecord/3.jpg')" alt="foo">
<p>Once you have selected a “List View” to make a copy of, click on the gear icon in the upper right hand corner of the screen. Select “Clone”.
Click on the gear icon again and then click on <strong>“Select Fields to Display”</strong>... From here you can select any field from the application &amp; enrollment to appear in the list.

<h4 id="phone-confirmations-inline-editing"> <strong>Phone Confirmations (Inline Editing):</strong></h4>
<p>For the most efficient update of application information—use the “inline” editing function of SFDC. This means that rather than clicking on each individual application to update, you will work within the related list instead. Note that not all fields on records in a list view can be edited inline. To find out whether a field supports inline editing, hover over it and look for the pencil. Non-editable cells have a lock.
Ensure that the field “Applicant Phone” is displayed in your “List View”. From the list, hover over the cell to edit, and then click . Or, double-click the cell. Alternatively, you can select the to the right of each row and select “Edit”.</p>
<p>Edit the “Stage” field to display the appropriate field “Registered” or “Denied” based on the result of the call.  Save button appears at the bottom of the list view.</p>
<p>Click Save. You have now finished confirming who will be attending your workshop.</p>
<h4 id="post-workshop-attendance-mass-update"> <strong>Post-Workshop Attendance (Mass Update)</strong></h4>
<p>Now that the workshop has ended, you can use your sign-in sheet to update SFDC. Go to your previously created workshop “List View”.</p>
<p>Use the checkboxes to the left of each row to select the participants who attended the workshop.</p>

      <category>Guide</category>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Doc Version:</strong> 2017</p>
<h2 id="objective"> <strong>Objective:</strong></h2>
<p>In this section you will find the basic theory about the reports and dashboards in Salesforce.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Beginner.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-report"> <strong>What is a report?</strong></h3>
<p>A report is a list of records that meet the criteria you define. It’s displayed in Salesforce in rows and columns, and can be filtered, grouped, or displayed in a graphical chart.
Every report is stored in a folder. Folders can be public, hidden, or shared, and can be set to read-only or read/write. You control who has access to the contents of the folder based on roles, permissions, public groups, and license types. You can make a folder available to your entire organization, or make it private so that only you, as the owner, have access.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-dashboard"> <strong>What is a dashboard?</strong></h3>
<p>A dashboard is a visual display of key metrics and trends for records in your org. The relationship between a dashboard component and report is 1:1; for each dashboard component, there is a single underlying report. However, you can use the same report in multiple dashboard components on a single dashboard (e.g., use the same report in both a bar chart and pie chart). Multiple dashboard components can be shown together on a single dashboard page layout, creating a powerful visual display and a way to consume multiple reports that often have a common theme, like sales performance, customer support, etc.
Like reports, dashboards are stored in folders, which control who has access. If you have access to a folder, you can view its dashboards. However, to view the dashboard components, you need access to the underlying reports as well. You can also follow a dashboard in Chatter to get updates about the dashboard posted to your feed.
Each dashboard has a running user, whose security settings determine which data to display in a dashboard. If the running user is a specific user, all dashboard viewers see data based on the security settings of that user—regardless of their own personal security settings. For this reason, you’ll want to choose the running user wisely, so as not to open up too much visibility. For example, set the Recruitment Coordinator as the running user for a dashboard for her team. This allows her team members to view the dashboard for their individual team, but not other teams.
Dynamic dashboards are dashboards for which the running user is always the logged-in user. This way, each user sees the dashboard according to his or her own access level. If you’re concerned about too much access, dynamic dashboards might be the way to go.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-report-type"> <strong>What is a report type?</strong></h3>
<p>A report type is like a template which makes reporting easier. The report type determines which fields and records are available for use when creating a report. This is based on the relationships between a primary object and its related objects. For example, with the ‘Contacts and Accounts’ report type, ‘Contacts’ is the primary object and ‘Accounts’ is the related object.
Reports display only records that meet the criteria defined in the report type. Out of the box, Salesforce provides a set of predefined standard report types. Don’t see all the fields you want? Your administrator might need to create a custom report type.</p>
<p>For example, an administrator can create a report type that shows only job applications that have an associated resume; applications without resumes won't show up in reports using that type. An administrator can also show records that may have related records—for example, applications with or without a welcome form. In this case, all applications, whether or not they have a welcome form, are available to reports using that type. An administrator can also add fields from a related object by creating a lookup relationship to that object, allowing for even more reporting possibilities.</p>

<h3 id="objective"> <strong>Objective:</strong></h3>
<p>In this section you will find information about support alerts in Salesforce.</p>

<p>| Link: <a href="https://www.tfaforms.com/4774032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.tfaforms.com/4774032</a></p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Beginner.</p>
<h3 id="why-support-alerts"> <strong>Why Support Alerts?</strong></h3>
<p>Creating Support Alerts in Salesforce allows you to request any type of Salesforce support you might need. This includes the Salesforce-connected tools that we use, such as Form Assembly for online forms and Mogli SMS for texting. By centralizing support requests as Support Alerts in Salesforce, you’re able to easily track the Support Alerts you’ve submitted, their statuses, and their resolutions. You can also see all the Support Alerts submitted across the agency, and may even be able to find the information you need in a completed Support Alert.</p>
<h3 id="support-type-examples"> <strong>Support Type Examples</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Duplicate:</strong> You found duplicate records in Salesforce for a person/registration/partner/business, etc and need them merged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deletion:</strong> You made a mistake creating a course/class, found a spam response, or created a test record and need it deleted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bug Report:</strong> Something isn’t working correctly! Things could be things like formulas not working, data missing, error messages, not being able to find a record, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Existing Form Change:</strong> An existing registration or data entry form needs updates. This includes fields being added or removed, courses or staff members being updated, typos, or changes to how data connects to Salesforce.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div><p>Note:</p>
<p><strong>New links for webinars or any other online form needs involving marketing/website calendar updates should continue to be requested via email to the entire Program Support Team.</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Report/Dashboard Request:</strong> You need a report/dashboard created or updated, or you need support using an existing report/dashboard. This includes “How can I see <strong>__</strong>” requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality Request:</strong> Salesforce needs to do something it isn’t currently doing. This includes new fields, page layout changes, automations, new buttons or actions, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Training Request:</strong> You need some additional Salesforce training! This includes individual or group/team training, general or content/object specific training, and written/visual/video training material requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other:</strong> What you need doesn’t fit into any of the above categories</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support-alert-priority"> <strong>Support Alert Priority</strong></h3>
<p>The guidelines for Priority levels are below.</p>
<p><strong>The Huitzi Solutions will adhere to these timeframes as much as possible</strong> – the nature of some requests may require additional time due to information gathering, testing, or scheduling. You will be notified as soon as possible if your request cannot be completed in the designated time frame. If your request does not need to be completed within 5 business days, you can select Future and enter the date needed.</p>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/supportAlertIntroduction/1.jpg')" alt="foo">
<h3 id="what-happens-after-submitting-a-support-alert"> <strong>What Happens After Submitting A Support Alert?</strong></h3>
<p>Your Support Alert status will be updated within 24 hours (or 1 business day) and <strong>the Huitzi Solutions team will reach out if any additional information or details are needed.</strong></p>
<p>You can check the status of your Support Alerts at any point by using the My Support Alerts list at the top of your Salesforce Home Page. This list shows all Support Alerts you’ve submitted, including completed ones.</p>
<p>When your request has been completed, the Huizti Solutions team will update the Response or Resolution field, mark the Status as completed, and enter the Resolved Date. You will receive an email notifying you that your Support Alert is complete. This email links directly to the Support Alert record, where you can review Response or Resolution information.</p>
<h4 id="support-alert-lists"> <strong>Support Alert Lists</strong></h4>
<p>My Support Alerts is a list at the top of your Salesforce Home Page. This list allows you to see all Support Alerts you’ve submitted, along with the Created Date, Status, Priority, and Resolved Date for each one.</p>
<p>To view Support Alerts submitted by others, open the Support Alerts tab on your navigation bar. You may need to use the More arrow to find it. Then click on the Recently Viewed arrow at the upper left of your screen to find additional lists. You can find lists grouped by teams, Support Type, or Status. This allows you to see what other Support Alerts are in the pipeline – and allows you to see if your issue/question has previously been answered.</p>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> In this section you will find how to create a 641 Form and business consulting appointment</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Advanced.</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Begin by searching in the global search bar (the Search Salesforce box at the top of your screen) for the participant– either by part of their name or the last 4 digits of their phone number. This ensures you avoid any search issues due to nicknames, misspellings, married/divorced names, double last names, etc.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/businessAppointments/businessPathways1.png')" alt="foo">
<p><strong>Note: If you find two or more Contacts for a client, let the Evaluation Coordinator know so they can merge the records. In the meantime, open both Contact records and continue with whichever Contact has a 641 Form. If neither does, pick one of the Contact records and continue</strong></p>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/businessAppointments/businessApt2.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Once in their Contact record, check to see if they have a 641 Form by clicking on the Related tab and looking at the Forms tile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you find a 641 Form, open the Form record by click on the Form name (Form-#####).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/businessAppointments/businessApt3.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="4">
<li>Once in the Form record, use the “Click here to add a Part 3 appointment” link to add a new appointment.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/businessAppointments/businessApt4.png')" alt="foo">
<p>This link opens a new tab for Form Assembly. The first thing you see will be a confirmation that you are skipping Parts 1 and 2, because they’re already in Salesforce. Click Next Page to go to the rest of the Part 3 form.</p>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/businessAppointments/businessApt5.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="5">
<li>On the Part 3 page, any company information that has previously been recorded will auto-fill the corresponding form fields. Revenue/Sales and Profits/Losses will need to be completed, at the bottom. Select the appropriate Course from the list provided.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/businessAppointments/businessApt6.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="6">
<li>Complete the entirety of the form and click Submit on page 3 when finished.
If you’d like to ensure that the appointment was captured, return to the 641 Form record (the tab should still be open), refresh your browser, and notice the newly entered appointment in the Appointments tile.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/businessAppointments/businessApt7.png')" alt="foo">

<ol start="10">
<li>Fill out the entirety of the form and click Submit on page 3 when finished.
If you’d like to ensure that the Contact, Business Account (if applicable), Form, and Appointment were captured, return to your Salesforce home screen – clicking Submit on the 641 data entry form should take you back to your Salesforce home screen. Refresh your browser, and then use the global search bar at the top to find the new Contact record. In the new Contact record, you can find the new Business Account (if applicable), Form, and Appointment records.</li>

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/businessAppointments/businessApt11.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="11">
<li>Since there is no existing 641 Form for this client, you’ll need to add one. Return to the Details tab of the Contact record, and use the “Click here to enter a new 641 Form” link to add a 641.</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/businessAppointments/businessApt12.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="12">

<li>Fill out the entirety of the form and click Submit on page 3 when finished.

<ol>
<li>
<p>As soon as you’ve entered the Business Consulting appointment (or the initial 641 form), send the participant a Business Counseling Survey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If adding a follow-up appointment, click on the participant’s name at the top of the Form to return to their Contact record. If adding a new case appointment, you should already be on the participant’s Contact record.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/businessAppointments/survey1.png')" alt="foo">
<ol start="3">
<li>On the right side of the Contact record, find the Activity box. Just below the words Activity and Chatter, click on the Email tab.</li>

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/businessAppointments/survey5.jpeg')" alt="foo">
<p><em>Note: You will likely see a warning about overwriting your current email – this is fine, because “current email” is just your email signature, and the template includes your email signature. Click Insert.</em></p>

<li>This will open the list of available templates to use. Select the Counseling Survey template of the appropriate language for your participant.</li>

<h1 id="process-builders"> <strong>Process Builders</strong></h1>
<p>Process Builder is a tool in Salesforce that is commonly used to automate processes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create records,</li>
<li>Update a record,</li>
<li>Submit a record for approval,</li>
<li>Send emails using specified email templates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-process"> <strong>Anatomy of a Process</strong></h2>
<p>Every process consists of a trigger, at least one criteria node, and at least one action. You can configure inmediat actions or scheduled actions to be executed at a specific time.
Here is an example of a simple process:</p>
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/processBuilders/anatomyProcessBuilder.png')" alt="foo">
<ol>
<li>Parent Object: Every process builder needs to start by making reference to a parent object. This object will make available the data that will be used in the process. For example, the process shown in the diagram above will make data from the opportunity object available to use in the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, Process Builder will attach a trigger to the object, which will determine when the process should run. There are two options for triggers that can be chosen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only when a record is created</li>
<li>Anytime a record is created or edited</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Criteria: In process builder, it is possible to add as many criteria nodes as desired. Each criteria node controls whether or not the process executes the associated actions. If the record doesn’t meet the criteria, the process skips those actions and moves on to the next criteria node in the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>In each criteria node, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set filter conditions.</li>
<li>Enter a custom formula. Like in validation rules, the formula must resolve to true or false.</li>
<li>Opt out of criteria and always execute the associated actions.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Immediate Actions: If the record meets the conditions defined on the criteria, all the actions defined on this section will be executed immediately. For example, if all the criteria is met, the process will email a draft of a contract to a set of email addresses immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scheduled Actions: If the record meets the conditions defined on the criteria, all the actions defined on this section will be executed at the scheduled time. For example, if all the criteria is met, the process will send a reminder to a set of email addresses after 6 days.</p>
</li>
</ol>
